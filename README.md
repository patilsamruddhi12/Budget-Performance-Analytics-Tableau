📊 Budget Allocation & Performance Analytics Using Tableau
________________________________________
🚀 Project Overview

This project analyzes how organizational budgets are allocated, utilized, and translated into performance outcomes across multiple divisions and time periods. Using interactive Tableau dashboards, the analysis explores spending intensity, budget variability, performance efficiency, and ROI alignment to support data-driven strategic decision-making.

The objective is to help stakeholders:

•	Understand where budgets are concentrated

•	Identify high-risk, high-variance spending periods

•	Evaluate whether higher investment leads to better performance

•	Highlight high-value divisions and projects
